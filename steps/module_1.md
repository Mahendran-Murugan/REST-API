# Django Rest Framework (DRF) Course - Module 1
This is my DRF course. I hope you like it.

> These notes follow on from the README.md getting started instructions.

## Current root directory
Your root directory should look like the following.
```
drf_course\  <--This is the root directory
    backend\
        docker\
            ...
        >requirements.txt
    steps\
        ...
    >.gitignore
    >docker-compose.yml
    >env.template
    >README.md
    >server.py
```
If in doubt, run the following git commands:
```
git checkout module_1
git pull origin module_1
```

## Steps/Commands
You should now have a directory called 'drf_course' in your development directory. This will be known as your 'root directory'.

In this module, we will be start our project. To do this we will need to create a virtual environment.
>Note: Python virtual env docs can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).

1) Virtual Environment - Open a terminal and use the following command to create a virtual environment. 
```
python -m venv venv
```
Now activate the virtual environment with the following command.
```
# windows machine
venv\Scripts\activate.bat

#mac/linux
source venv/bin/activate
```
You will know your virtual environment is active when your terminal displays the following:
```
(venv) path\to\project\drf_course>
```

2) Packages and requirements - Our project will rely on a whole bunch of 3rd party packages (requirements) to function. We will be using a Python package manager to install packages throughout this course. 
I have already created a requirements.txt file. Check out /backend/requirements.txt
```
asgiref==3.5.2
Django==4.1.3
django-extensions==3.2.1
django-filter==22.1
djangorestframework==3.14.0
djangorestframework-jsonapi==6.0.0
inflection==0.5.1
python-dotenv==0.21.0
pytz==2022.6
sqlparse==0.4.3
tzdata==2022.6
```
Let's go ahead and install our project requirements. Add the following code to you terminal.

```
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

3) Django - You can now go ahead and start a new Django project. Installing Django has given you access to a handy 'startproject' command. Use the following command to start our new project.
```
django-admin startproject drf_course backend
```

4) Secrets and Environment Variables - It is good practice to separate sensitive information from your project. We have installed a package called 'python-dotenv' that helps us manage secrets easily. Lets go ahead and create a env file to store information that is specific to our working environment. Use the following command in your terminal.

```
# windows machine
copy env.template .env

#mac/linux
cp env.template .env
```

You can use your new .env file to store API keys, secret_keys, app_passwords and you will gain access to these in the Django app.

## New Root directory
>Note: If all went well, your root directory should now look like this
```
drf_course\  <--This is the root directory
    backend\
        docker\
            ...
        drf_course\
            >__init__.py
            >asgi.py
            >settings.py
            >urls.py
            >wsgi.py
        >manage.py
        >requirements.txt
    steps\
        ...
    venv\ <--New directory
        include\
        Lib\
        Scripts\
    >.env <--New file
    >.gitignore
    >docker-compose.yml
    >env.template
    >README.md
    >server.py
```
